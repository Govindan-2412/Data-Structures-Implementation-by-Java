 ***Data-Structures-Implementation-by-Java***
 
 Data structure is a way to store and organize the data so,that it can be used efficiently.

I have learned the theory concepts and implemented the data structures in java

Topics:-
     
     *Singly linked list
     *Doubly linked list
     *Circular linked list
     *Stack Implementation using array.
     *Stack Implementation using linkedlist
     *Queue Implementation using array
     *Queue Implementation using linkedlist
     <-->Binary Tree<-->
     *Preorder,Inorder,Postorder Implementation using Recursion
     *Preorder,Inorder,Postorder Implementation using Iterative Method.
     *BinaryTree Level Order Traversal
     *Directed graph representation using adjacency matrix
     *UnDirected graph representation using adjacency matrix.
     *Weighted Directed graph representation using adjacency matrix.
